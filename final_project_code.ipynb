    "    Formula 1 is the highest level of motorsport league for single-driver racing cars. In a Formula 1 season, there are a number of Grands Prix which is a series of races that occur on tracks called circuits. When racing, both drivers and the constructors, who are the teams and makers of the cars, earn points for winning, the fastest lap, and other benchmarks. Only drivers who place in the top 10 earn points. At the end of a Formula 1 season, the driver with the highest number of points wins and the same goes for the constructors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We are probing into the question of whether drivers are more likely to win races at their hometown circuits. There are added expectations and increased excitement for drivers racing in their home country. As Formula 1 circuits occur worldwide, we want to uncover whether or not the homecourt advantage phenomenon is prevalent in this sport."

    "    Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data. In the given code, data cleaning is performed on the four datasets: circuits, drivers, results, and races. The cleaning steps include replacing certain values in the \"country\" and \"nationality\" columns to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data. For example, \"United States\" is replaced with \"USA,\" \"East German\" is combined with \"German,\" and \"American-Italian\" is combined with \"Italian.\" The goal of the data cleaning procedures is to prepare the data for analysis and ensure that the results are valid and reliable. We made all country names equal to the nationality that is associated with it in order to be able to match the winner’s home country with the country that each race took place in. Additionally, we made sure to recode all NA values for the milliseconds' column."

    "    We computed the column win_status by grouping the data by raceId and pulling the lowest milliseconds to indicate the winner. For each race, the driver with the lowest milliseconds was assigned a 1 and the rest were assigned a 0. The mean of win_status is 0.15 which indicates that there are more losers than winners which is expected. We also computed local_status to indicate when drivers were racing in their home country. The average for local_status is 0.07, indicating there are a small number of drivers who race in their home country. We also calculated the mean points which are ~6.26 with a maximum of 50. The median is 5 points which demonstrate that only drivers in the top 10 receive points and the rest get zero."
